# Deliberate Practice

We're going to iterate an implementation of [Project Euler problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) in Javascript via TDD.

1. Download [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=mac&code=IIC)
2. Get the current version of Node/NPM try the following
   - `$:brew doctor` update things that doctor mentions
   - `$:brew update` grab the latest brew information (this may take a while)
   - `$:brew info node` if we're installed, great. otherwise `brew install node`
   - `$:which node` should tell you node is installed by brew e.g. `/usr/local/bin/node`
   - `$:which npm` should say the same `/usr/local/bin/npm`
3. [Get Jasmine for node](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html)
4. Setup your project in IntelliJ

Implement a command line program in Javascript to solve Project Euler problem 1.
