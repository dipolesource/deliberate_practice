# Deliberate Practice

We're going to iterate an implementation of [Project Euler problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) in Javascript via TDD.

1. Download [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=mac&code=IIC)
1. Install [node.js/npm with package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
1. Verify installation:
    - `which node` should tell you where node is installed e.g. `/usr/local/bin/node`
    - `which npm` should tell you the same e.g. `/usr/local/bin/npm`
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`, which should install [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html) for node.
1. Setup your project in IntelliJ

Implement a command line program in Javascript to solve Project Euler problem 1.
